        <p>I am a copyeditor and technical writer living in Austin, Texas. When I was young, I entertained myself by making up stories in my head, and eventually I started scribbling them down in notebooks. Now I write technical documentation and edit manuscripts for publication. In 2011, I received my masterâ€™s in writing from the New School University, and I was a 2013 Lambda Literary Fellow.</p>

        <p>Over the course of my career, I've worked in the newspaper production, book publishing, software, and finance industries as a technical writer, copyeditor, layout designer, and presentation specialist. I am fascinated by the structures in place in the world around my and love figuring out how they work, particularly in the areas of language, psychology, and visual design.</p>

        <p>When not working or writing, I can usually be found somersaulting through the air on the flying trapeze or contorting myself into strange shapes on the static trapeze. I like to snuggle on the couch with my spouse, Jill, and our dog, Rizzo, while watching <em>Law and Order: SVU</em> reruns. I also spend a lot of time tweeting and playing with Olive, Margo, and Jace, my three rescue cats.</p>
